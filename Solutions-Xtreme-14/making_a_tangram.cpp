/*
In this challenge you are to create a beautiful tangram from a board of N \times NN×N cells. The board will be cut into NN tangram pieces. Each piece consists of exactly NN cells that are 44-connected (up, down, left, right). All the tangram pieces shall together fit into the N \times NN×N board without extra or empty cells. To make the tangram fun, each piece will have a distinct color, and no two pieces shall be of a same shape.

Two tangram pieces are said to have a same shape if one can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise to look exactly the same as the other. For example, the following four pieces are the same:

These two pieces have different shapes:

A tangram piece is allowed to have holes, such as:



Now it is up to you to design the tangram in whatever way you like!


Standard input
The first line of the input has a single integer TT, the number of test cases.

Each of the next TT lines has one test case with a single integer NN, the size of the board.


Standard output
For each test case, output any tangram design that satisfies the requirement. The output has NN lines, each with NN characters. Mark each tangram piece with any unique character from the alphabet: lowercase letters a-z, uppercase letters A-Z, or digits 0-9. Any valid tangram will be accepted.

If there is no way to cut the board to make the tangram, output impossible on a single line.


Constraints and notes
1 \leq T \leq 201≤T≤20
2 \leq N \leq 622≤N≤62

impossible
In the first test case N = 5N=5, note that you may pick any characters from the alphabet to color the tangram pieces.

In the second test case N = 3N=3, only these two types pieces can be made. Therefore you cannot cut the board into three different pieces.
